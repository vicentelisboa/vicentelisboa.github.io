      <description>Classification of Yahoo Answers Introduction The goal of this project is to classify Yahoo! Answers posts into their respective topics. We use a dataset provided by Huggingface, which includes 2 million Yahoo! Answers posts categorized into ten topics. We select three topics - Health, Science &amp;amp; Mathematics, and Society &amp;amp; Culture - and sample 100,000 posts from the dataset for training and testing.
We apply several models to the task of classification, including rule-based models, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models.</description>

      <description>Introduction The following project has two objectives:
Predict the probability of death of a patient that is entering an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. Predict the length of stay (in days) of a patient that is entering an ICU using decision tree, ensembles and neural networks models. Dataset description The dataset comes from MIMIC project (https://mimic.physionet.org/). MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.</description>

      <description>This project highlights the scope for using text data from central bank statements to improve predictions about policy rates. The problem is constructed as a classification into three potential outcomes: the rate in the next period goes up, goes down, or stays the same. We test our approach with data from the central banks of Australia, Chile and Peru.
Main findings We find that a Random Forest Classifier trained only on economic data (e.</description>
